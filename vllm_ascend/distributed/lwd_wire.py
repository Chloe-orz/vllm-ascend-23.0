"""prefill_only duplex data-plane wire layer.

Owns the two physical channels (UP edge->cloud, DOWN cloud->edge):
  * channel HCCL communicators: two dedicated ``new_group`` groups over
    the PP-group rank set (the edge/cloud pair convention: pp rank 0 =
    edge endpoint, pp rank 1 = cloud endpoint, matching the demo
    topology);
  * one NPU stream per channel (wire ops are bridged onto it, keeping
    the compute stream free);
  * init-time warmup of both channels in both directions in a fixed
    global order (moves the first-use HCCL rendezvous out of the
    pipeline, where the two sides could otherwise arrive on different
    channels and deadlock).

Only prefill_only mode builds these groups; other modes never reach
here (gated by ``LwdConfig.is_prefill_only``).
